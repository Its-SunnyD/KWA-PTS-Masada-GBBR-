Don't like the stock grip on the pts masada?

Well I have spent over 40 hours modeling a exact replica reciver that uses standard pistol grips from ar-10's.

Here is mine printed out of ABS-GF filament.

Do note most dimenstions are exact/very close.  You may have to do post processing depending on what your 3d printer is capable of. Also I recoment only ABS filled filaments and Nylone filled as they need stiffness from the fill matrial but Abs and Nylon are tuff. Also they won't melt in your car on a hot day.
