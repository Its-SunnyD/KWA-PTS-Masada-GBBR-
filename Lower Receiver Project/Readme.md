Don't like the stock grip on the pts masada?

Well I have spent over 40 hours modeling a exact replica reciver that uses standard pistol grips from ar-10's.

The end goal of this project is to create a daytona mag well to allow for normal aeg mags with the air line comming out of the grip aera without removing/ subsiting the stock trigger box and mekanism block.  So Basically, the Magwell will be gettig the only real modifactions.  
Somthing like the picture below.  

But because you can not find replacements hence the model/printed lower.

Here is mine printed out of ABS-GF filament.

Do note most dimenstions are exact/very close.  You may have to do post processing depending on what your 3d printer is capable of. Also I recoment only ABS filled filaments and Nylone filled as they need stiffness from the fill matrial but Abs and Nylon are tuff. Also they won't melt in your car on a hot day.
