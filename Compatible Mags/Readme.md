## **Gas mags**

The most expensive part of any Gas Blow back rife.  

Knowing which mags work can allow us to choose what works best for our setups.

The PTS/KWA masada shares many of its internal design with the Lm4 platform.  As such all magazines that work with the lm4 gbbr work it the masada.  

So far Known working mags are the... 

EPM mags made by PTS.

KWA lm4 stang style mags. 

Co2 mags by 6mm proshop.

PMAGs -Like EPM mags but they have waffling on them.


## **MAG Issues**

The masada Made by PTS/KWA is very similar to the KWA LM4 platform, This includes its issues such as double feeding.

**The FIX**

This goes for EPM, Pmags, And stang style mags.  All these mags use double stack feed lips which allow for two bbs to enter the hop up chamber causing a jam and dumping all your gas.

The soulution to this issue is to use single stack feed lips.  This ensures there is only one bb exposed at a time for the Bolt to come feed into the hop up.

Single stack feed lips allow for the double stack mag to feed out to single right where it feeds into the rifle.

**EPM/Pmag**

This would be a replacement for EPM mags/ Pmags if you want Plastic feed lips.

For EPM mags I do highly recomend CNC feed lips made by Nemas Armory, Its a one and done solution for EPM/pmags

**Stang Mags**

Unlike Epm/Pmags, the feed lips do not crack or deform as much or as easily.  But they still can if the rifle is used alot.

They do alright with the orginal feed lips and so far there hasnt been a perfect solution yet.  

Nema's Armory has a cnc preorder of the stang mags cnc feed lips as of 10/15/24 but you will no longer be able to load them from the top.

Current solution is to buy backup feed lips from your local distruibor or shops.
