## **Gas mags**

The most expensive part of any Gas Blow back rife.  

Knowing which mags work can allow us to choose what works best for our setups.

The PTS/KWA masada shares many of its internal design with the Lm4 platform.  As such all magazines that work with the lm4 gbbr work it the masada.  

So far Known working mags are the... 

EPM mags made by PTS.

KWA lm4 stang style mags. 

Co2 mags by 6mm proshop.

PMAGs -Like EPM mags but they have waffling on them.


## **MAG Issues**

The masada Made by PTS/KWA is very similar to the KWA LM4 platform, This includes its issues such as double feeding.

**The FIX**

This goes for EPM, Pmags, And stang style mags.  All these mags use double stack feed lips which allow for two bbs to enter the hop up chamber causing a jam and dumping all your gas.

The soulution to this issue is to use single stack feed lips.  This ensures there is only one bb exposed at a time for the Bolt to come feed into the hop up.

Single stack feed lips allow for the double stack mag to feed out to single right where it feeds into the rifle.

This would be a replacement for EPM mags/ Pmags if you want Plastic feed lips.
