## **Masada Bolt carrier upgrade**

The OEM masada bolt is decent and for most causal players, It will last longer then most will even use the rifle.

But to those who use their rifle extensivly like I do, we need a better solution as they break from heavy use. 
Ive gone through two bolts after 10k rounds through each, they fatigue and crack or ballon out were the nozzle slides in and out.  
Years ago esd made a steel bolt but they have since discontinued it.  
The problem with steel bolts is that they impart more wear on the whole rifle epecially on the trigerbox reset pins/sears

My attempt so far is to have one made out of 7075-t6 aluminum as it is tuff like most steels but light weight.

**Update: 9-29-24** I have ordered a prototype to see if my desgin fits and functions.  I have 3D printed prototypes out of abs plastic and they fit but cant be used for testing rifle function. The CNC 7075 part will take a month to arrive.
