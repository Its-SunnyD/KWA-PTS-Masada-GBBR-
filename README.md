## **Airsoft Masada Only**

Hello Fellow Pts Masada Gbbr owners and or those looking to join the platform.  

Name is Sunny, I go by Its_SunnyD on the GBBR Heavy Recoil Club discord.

This Git hub page is going to be a full data base on the Masada GBBR platform.
This will include stl files, How to Videos on upgrades and disassembly, Product links to know vendors of parts and upcomming upgrades.

So far info is being lossed on the Platform and as this is one of my most favorite Rifles, I would love to see a colection of info on these suckers. 

Join me by expanding this datebase to aid future owners or even our future selfs.
